        <p>Across Africa, millions of people live with disabilities, yet face barriers that limit their access to education, employment, healthcare, and full participation in society. The One Africa Alliance Program for People Living with Disabilities (PLWD) is dedicated to breaking down these barriers, fostering inclusion, and promoting equal rights and opportunities.</p>

        <p>Our mission is to empower PLWD through advocacy, inclusive policies, accessible infrastructure, and community-driven initiatives that enable dignity, independence, and social integration.</p>

        <h2>Why Inclusion of People Living with Disabilities Matters</h2>
        <p>Inclusion is a fundamental human right and essential for social justice and economic development. When people with disabilities are supported and included, communities thrive, economies grow, and societies become more resilient.</p>
        <p>Yet, stigma, discrimination, and lack of resources continue to exclude many. Our program envisions a continent where all people, regardless of ability, can live with dignity and contribute fully.</p>
